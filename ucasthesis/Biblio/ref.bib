Our goal is to provide a readable, open-source implementation for use in education, research, and industry.

BOOM is written in roughly 9,000 lines of the hardware construction language Chisel. We leveraged Berkeley’s open-source Rocket-chip SoC generator, allowing us to quickly bring up an entire multi-core processor system (including caches and uncore) by replacing the in-order Rocket core with an out-of-order BOOM core. BOOM supports atomics, IEEE 754-2008 floating-point, and page-based virtual memory. We have demonstrated BOOM running Linux, SPEC CINT2006, and CoreMark.}

    Abstract = {This paper presents BOOM version 2, an updated version of the Berkeley Out-of-Order Machine. The design exploration was performed through synthesis, place and route using the foundry-provided standard-cell library and the memory compiler in the TSMC 28 nm HPM process (high performance mobile).

BOOM is an open-source processor that implements the RV64G RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). Like most contemporary high-performance cores, BOOM is superscalar (able to execute multiple instructions per cycle) and out-of-order (able to execute instructions as their dependencies are resolved and not restricted to their program order).  BOOM is implemented as a parameterizable generator written using the Chisel hardware construction language that can used to generate synthesizable implementations targeting both FPGAs and ASICs.

BOOMv2 is an update in which the design effort has been informed by analysis of synthesized, placed and routed data provided by a contemporary industrial tool flow. We also had access to standard single- and dual-ported memory compilers provided by the foundry, allowing us to explore design trade-offs using different SRAM memories and comparing against synthesized flip-flop arrays. The main distinguishing features of BOOMv2 include an updated 3-stage front-end design with a bigger set-associative Branch Target Buffer (BTB); a pipelined register rename stage; split floating point and integer register files; a dedicated floating point pipeline; separate issue windows for floating point, integer, and memory micro-operations; and separate stages for issue-select and register read.  

Managing the complexity of the register file was the largest obstacle to improving BOOM's clock frequency. We spent considerable effort on placing-and-routing a semi-custom 9-port register file to explore the potential improvements over a fully synthesized design, in conjunction with microarchitectural techniques to reduce the size and port count of the register file. BOOMv2 has a 37 fanout-of-four (FO4) inverter delay after synthesis and 50 FO4 after place-and-route, a 24% reduction from BOOMv1's 65 FO4 after place-and-route. Unfortunately, instruction per cycle (IPC) performance drops up to 20%, mostly due to the extra latency between load instructions and dependent instructions. However, the new BOOMv2 physical design paves the way for IPC recovery later.}

    Abstract = {General-purpose serial-thread performance gains have become more difficult for industry to realize due to the slowing down of process improvements. In this new regime of poor process scaling, continued performance improvement relies on a number of small-scale micro- architectural enhancements. However, software simulator-based models, which computer architecture research has largely relied upon, may not be well-suited for evaluating ideas at the necessary fidelity.

To facilitate architecture research during this fallow period of Moore’s Law, we propose using processor simulators built from synthesizable processor designs. This thesis describes the design of a synthesizable, industry-competitive processor built on recent advancements in open-source hardware: we leverage the new open-source RISC-V instruction set architecture, the new Chisel hardware construction language, and the Rocket-chip processor generator.

Our processor generator is called BOOM, and it designed for use in education, research, and industry. Like most contemporary high-performance cores, BOOM is superscalar (able to execute multiple instructions per cycle) and out-of-order (able to execute instructions as their dependencies are resolved and not restricted to their program order).
The BOOM generator was implemented using the Chisel hardware construction language, allowing for the rapid implementation of parameterized designs. The Chisel description generates synthesizable implementations of BOOM that can target both FPGAs and ASIC tool-flows. The BOOM effort culminated in a test chip that was fabricated in the TSMC 28 nm HPM process (high performance mobile) using the foundry-provided standard-cell library and memory compiler.

This thesis highlights two aspects of the BOOM design: its industry-competitive branch prediction and its configurable execution datapath. The remainder of the thesis discusses the BOOM tape-out, which was performed by two graduate students and demonstrated the ability to quickly adapt the design to the physical design issues that arose.}
